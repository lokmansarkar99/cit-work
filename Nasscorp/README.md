## Problem & Challanges & Solution:

###  Problem 1: Relative Positioning (CSS)

The unwanted space (approximately 250px) was created because two sections, `#contact-form` and `footer`, used **`position: relative`** combined with a **negative `top` value**.

| Element | Original CSS (Cause) | Effect on Layout |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`#contact-form`** | `position: relative; top: -350px;` | Visually moves the element up, but **preserves its original 350px of space** in the document flow, pushing the `footer` down. |
| **`footer`** | `position: relative; top: -250px;` | Visually moves the footer up, but **preserves its original 250px of space** at the very end of the document, resulting in the final empty gap. |

**Key Takeaway:** `position: relative` should be avoided for layout adjustments when you need subsequent elements to occupy the vacated space.

###  Solution 1: Switching to Negative Margins

The fix involves replacing the `position: relative` and `top` properties with **negative `margin-top`**. Negative margins pull the element up without preserving its original space, allowing the following content to flow correctly.

#### 1. Fix the Contact Form (`./css/style.css`)

I eliminate the footprint of the contact form by removing the positioning and applying a negative margin:

```css
/* ================= Contact Form Start Here================= */

#contact-form {
  /* REMOVED: position: relative; */
  /* REMOVED: top: -350px; */

  /* NEW: Pulls the form up, eliminating its footprint */
  margin-top: -350px; 
}
